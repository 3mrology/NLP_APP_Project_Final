It might be helpful to speak with a mental health professional who can provide a proper diagnosis and treatment options.\n\nASSESSMENT: Panic Disorder\n```\n\n### Step 1: Identify the key symptoms described by the user.\nThe user describes episodes where their heart races, they can't breathe, and they feel like they're dying. These episodes come out of nowhere and are terrifying. Additionally, the user expresses fear of having another episode.\n\n### Step 2: Match the symptoms with the conditions listed.\nThe symptoms of racing heart, shortness of breath, and fear of dying during episodes, along with the fear of having another episode, closely align with the characteristics of Panic Disorder. Panic Disorder is marked by recurrent panic attacks, which are discrete periods of intense fear or discomfort that develop abruptly and reach a peak within minutes, and include symptoms like palpitations, shortness of breath, and fear of dying or losing control.\n\n### Step 3: Consider if the symptoms could also indicate other conditions.\nWhile the symptoms of a racing heart and shortness of breath could potentially be associated with anxiety disorders, the specific pattern of recurrent episodes and the fear of having another episode more directly points towards Panic Disorder. The other conditions like Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Bipolar Disorder have different key indicators that are not explicitly mentioned in the user's description.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the most likely condition based on the symptoms described.\nGiven the information provided, the symptoms most closely align with the criteria for Panic Disorder, which includes recurrent panic attacks and fear of experiencing another episode.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{Panic Disorder}$ ```python\ndef assess_condition():\n    # Given user symptoms\n    symptoms = [\"racing heart\", \"can't breathe\", \"feel like dying\", \"fear of having another episode\"]\n    \n    # Conditions and their key indicators\n    conditions = {\n        \"Major Depressive Disorder\": [\"persistent sadness\", \"loss of interest\", \"fatigue\", \"sleep issues\", \"feelings of worthlessness\"],\n        \"Generalized Anxiety Disorder\": [\"excessive worry\", \"restlessness\", \"difficulty concentrating\", \"irritability\", \"muscle tension",
