                <h3>Symptom and Behavior Recognition</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <p>A distinguishing feature of our Neo4j Knowledge Graph Chatbot is its ability to identify specific symptoms and behaviors beyond disorder classification. While competing systems only provide disorder labels, our system accurately identified key symptoms (e.g., "Depression," "Anxiety," "Panic attacks") and behaviors (e.g., "Diminished interest," "Excessive worry," "Racing thoughts") that inform the diagnostic process.</p>
                
                <p>For example, in test case DEP-01, our system identified:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Depression, Excessive Sleepiness</li>
                    <li><strong>Behaviors:</strong> Diminished interest, Fatigue</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>This granular analysis provides significantly more clinical value than simply stating "Major Depressive Disorder" as the other systems do. The ability to recognize specific symptoms and behavioral patterns makes our system more useful for actual clinical screening purposes.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <p>Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that the Neo4j Knowledge Graph Chatbot significantly outperforms alternative approaches in mental health disorder identification across multiple dimensions:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Superior Accuracy:</strong> Achieved 100% accuracy in both single-turn and multi-turn conversations across all disorder categories</li>
                    <li><strong>Robust Disorder Recognition:</strong> Consistently identified all four mental health disorders (Depression, Anxiety, Bipolar, Panic)</li>
                    <li><strong>Detailed Symptom and Behavior Identification:</strong> Provided granular analysis beyond simple disorder labels</li>
                    <li><strong>Conversation Context Understanding:</strong> Successfully tracked and integrated information across multi-turn conversations</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>The primary trade-off observed was increased response latency (7.50 seconds versus near-instantaneous for rule-based approaches), which is attributable to the comprehensive graph traversal operations. However, this latency is still within acceptable parameters for real-world clinical screening applications, where accuracy is paramount.</p>
                
                <p>These results validate our hypothesis that a knowledge graph-based approach can more effectively model the complex relationships between symptoms, behaviors, and mental health disorders than either simple rule-based systems or large language models without domain-specific knowledge structures.</p>

                <p>Our proposed system leverages a comprehensive knowledge graph to identify mental health disorders based on symptom patterns and behavioral indicators. The system's strengths include:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Perfect accuracy (100%)</strong> across all test cases</li>

                <p>The primary limitation was increased response latency (7.50s) compared to simpler systems, though this remains acceptable for most clinical applications.</p>
